I want to build other channels like beast gaming and beast reacts so I can run my main channel at a loss and grow as big as possible. And then use my main channel’s influence to one day open hundreds of homeless shelters/food banks and give away all the money.;12600;20200;327300
Like this tweet if you want to be a Youtuber one day;9300;6500;328800

Just finished recording something for Mr Beast’s YouTube Rewind...;29200;38300;431000
I bought a million Christmas lights and 3 houses. Whoever designed their house the best got to keep the house! :);2200;1900;131100
I see your tweets and I’m trying to double and triple the amount of restaurants asap! I want you all to be able to try a MrBeast Burgers ;8900;3100;171300
DUDE THIS IS SO DOPE  @MrBeastYT;368;1000;50300
I betrayed my master ;926;1000;63800
Thank you for supporting MrBeast Burgers!!!! I love this community so much ;3500;2500;215100
I’m sorry the app keeps crashing, 10s of thousands of people keep trying to order at the same time  We upgraded the servers so it should be fine now!;1100;616;68100
I just launched 300 restaurants nationwide! Just go on your favorite delivery app and order a MrBeast Burger! WE’VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR FOREVER AND IM SO EXCITED!;14100;21000;316900
This video will go up on Christmas ;557;308;32000
We just filmed our most insane video ever and I’m dying for you to see it   (bigger then the private island series);2400;1600;127000
We’ve been filming for the past 20 hours and we’re about to pass out;1600;1100;118800
Over your lifetime you’ve had 10’s of thousands of dreams but you can’t remember any of them;4100;2700;190000

One dude used a big brain move and cleared a rack of gift cards ;499;271;45000
I gave random subscribers $1,000,000 but only 1 minute to spend it! Go watch!;2300;1100;88400
I might make a “How To Be A YouTuber” course to raise money for a really really expensive video I want to do lol;1800;951;100900
Green apples are better than red apples. Sorry;10600;10100;209600

Ayyy, we didn’t lose to Tana this year ;1600;1200;148100
And the #streamys Creator of the Year is...  @MrBeastYT ! A HUGE congratulations! ;1400;4700;97700
Almost all of MrBeast's videos this year have hit 20M+ views.  I remember when 10M used to be the standard lol;193;300;18000
Fan meetup;3400;5500;211200
Has anyone opened a single fleet in the past week?;3200;978;82900
If I can get these videos to go viral, it’s going to be insane what we can accomplish! After we start a few food banks I’d love to expand into some homeless shelters :);360;353;32900
So far our Food Bank has given out over 30,000 meals! We want to get the hang of things before we start making content for the philanthropy channel, can’t wait to show you guys this :);820;1300;76000
Give me likes on my birthday;2700;1800;177900
Who gave me much power?;2100;1800;159000
If colleges made videos like Kurzgesat, I’d probably have like 10 degrees lol;358;710;32700
I live for the day that you just watch a giant YouTube playlist of recorded college classes and that’s enough to take tests and get a degree.;890;1300;73900
Any small youtuber want to give me 10% of your channel for like $10k to $100k? (Depends on ur size) Let’s run an experiment and see how it works lol;6600;903;48600
Like when I see a channel that I think will blow up, I wish I could just like buy shares in it or something lol;885;319;42900
I wish there was a way to invest in social media influencers! Idk anything about the stock market and I find it boring.;2700;1200;104200
:));5900;2000;156300
The more money I give away in a video, the more people just don’t believe it’s real.  How would I even find that many actors??? I’ve literally given away money to thousands of people ;8600;2100;159900

Just started playing chess a few days ago, any creators want to play? I’m addicted ;4300;1000;114100
My comment section has informed me 91,231 times that I didn’t say your name right in the new video  @Lazarbeam  . I just wanted to publicly apologize for me being absolutely trash at remembering names.;564;418;76700
hi mum   im in a  @MrBeastYT  video;509;494;64099
It’s up!;157;72;13500
Just uploaded! Go watch or I’ll kick you in the face;1500;525;70100
FINALLY, after a year of trying we got custom lasers that look good on camera! Tomorrow’s video is epic :);902;740;77200
If this channel brings in the kind of money I think it will, I think we will quickly be able to expand to dozens of communities and feed hundreds of thousands of people ;488;388;26100
Our food bank is coming along nicely! In a month or so I’m going to start posting on this channel videos of us feeding communities and 100% of all revenue will go towards food and expanding the charity. I can’t wait :));1100;1500;45100
If any other creators want to help just reply! I’m going to need it ;4000;962;138300
Since YouTube isn’t making a rewind this year, I’m going to :);7700;11500;419500
This thing is on top of my timeline;303;313;17800
Twitter added stories! Now all our crippling social media addictions have another thing to waste time on everyday :));852;1600;81600
Today, MrBeast became the 242nd YouTube Channel to pass the World Population in Total Channel views at around 7.826B!;514;1000;49400
I made an alt twitter so I can be extra weird;1900;1200;128600
I set up a button that when you pressed it you’d either get $100,000 or a punishment! Go watch to see how many people pressed it!;1100;704;67500
i think  @MrBeastYT  should make Rewind 2020.;648;2300;84700
Half way thru my walk it started raining and now I’m wet. Can I get sympathy likes?;2800;849;154500
Just to put it out there I didn’t make this to flex. I was curious if there was a way to show how growth on YouTube is exponential! Feel free to do the same for your channels and share below!;678;227;46100
This is how many views I got on YouTube during each year of my life.  22 - 3,487,571,441 (So far) 21 - 3,324,451,660 20 - 2,099,879,911 19 - 464,282,517 18 - 122,441,813 17 - 5,482,596 16 - 202,000 15 - 125,634 14 - 41,148 13 - 7,000 12 - 15,000;2300;2500;141500
So just to be clear we are no longer accepting new cars! I’m super sorry, just trying to be responsible and not slow down traffic! I LOVE YOU ALL! This was insane ;189;129;27900
Genuinely, you guys are insane and next time I’ll try to rent like a city or something ;354;371;38500
We are no longer accepting cars to the free restaurant! We thought the giant parking lot we had would be enough to handle all the cars but there is a 20 mile line  If you’re not in the parking lot currently aka on the road, I LOVE YOU AND THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT ;682;641;65900

There is still a ginormous line! I wouldn’t recommend you drive from far away because we are closing tonight (obviously) and we are struggling to keep up with the demand ;312;131;23400
I opened a free restaurant (it’s drive thru only) but the line is so insanely long already that it’d be pointless to tweet the address. We have so many people waiting and idk how they even found the place ;613;392;39500
This is the oldest tweet on my account, help me ratio it so dream and tommy can’t!;338;312;31900

I remember feeling like a weirdo when I was younger because I couldn’t relate to anyone and people would always tell me to stop talking about YouTube so much.;560;352;44900
Over the last decade I’ve probably spent 90%+ of my waking hours thinking about how to make better YouTube videos. I have a problem lol;1200;803;98900

Or just make whatever predictions you want!  I think in 5 years tv will be mostly irrelevant.;589;302;24200
I want to do something like the “hi me in 5 years” video but for twitter! This tweet will automatically retweet in 5 years.  Reply with how big you think the channel is and what we’ll be doing and then when this is retweeted in 5 years we can compare it with reality! ;9400;3000;77600

Me and  @MarkRober  will prob do an update vid on the 1 year anniversary! ;190;296;34900
TeamTrees was so much fun, these random memes bring back so many memories ;602;3000;96800

Let’s make it where people don’t have to choose between paying rent or eating food.;339;857;32900
Finally worked out all the legal stuff and now we are securing/up fitting a warehouse for the food bank! I’m dying to start up the new channel where 100% of all ad rev, merch, and brand deals will go towards running the food bank! I want to see how big we can grow this ;1400;5200;123100
Among us with 100 players? Friday on the gaming channel ;757;1200;47500
To get 100 million views all you have to do is buy 100 million of something lol;494;339;34500
;1500;1500;85600
I was put up against a neuroscience major with a perfect SAT score and his equally talented wife in a TRIVIA competition in a 1v2.  this is going to be the worst loss of my life;2700;2600;110400
Mans got knowledge in his name so this is an easy dub;1000;1100;55600
Whoever wins the next creator games gets $300,000 to give away to their fans so I’d become a fan of all of them if you’re not already ;1900;2100;60400
hehe;127;110;9500
and whoever wins gets $300,000 to giveaway to their fans.. ;346;342;26900
and whoever wins gets $300,000 to giveaway to their fans.. ;346;342;26900
. @MrBeastYT  is back to present #TheCreatorGames 2! He's inviting 24 Creators to compete on October 17 in all new challenges for even bigger prizes. Keep your eyes peeled for the matchups ;351;1100;18800
Creator Games is back for round 2 on October 17th! These 24 Creators will be competing in Trivia to see who the smartest creator in the world is  Reply who you think will win!;5700;5200;88300
This is when I peaked;1300;2400;94300
I haven’t worm a tie in 500 years so I thought you should know I broke the streak;2400;3000;185600
If people say you’re being sus just show them this tweet. Hey, he isn’t being sus for voting green, he is just listening to science. Back off;162;370;30100
When in doubt, always vote green out in Among Us. You’re welcome.;1600;2900;103200
Me and Mark Rober did something.. go watch :);871;1100;65099
Instagram stories with my feet, 1.8 million views. Instagram stories without my feet, 1.2 million views. Why do 600,000 like my feet so much? ;621;464;28300
Don’t tell the rich people but this is a negotiation tactic. I’d obviously be fine with a million dollars but I have to start off with something crazy so the mil seems more reasonable. Don’t tell them though ;421;400;45800
I have a cool idea!;379;317;44700
I doubt this will work but it’s worth a shot. Any of you super rich people out there want to give me 10 million dollars to giveaway in a video? Pretty plz;5600;4200;167300
I asked my friend what my deodorant smells like and he said “blue”...   It’s been a few hours and I’m still confused;2000;1800;86200
“Hey Mr US Navy, can I borrow a ship for like two days? I promise I’ll return it!”;636;898;55700
The US Navy seems to like our videos (probably the weirdest sentence I’ve ever typed  ) I’m going to ask them if I can borrow a ship for a video. Wish me luck lol;1100;2700;97300
Who here wants to get paid to use social media all day?;17000;2800;84900
I want to spend less time on social media but I also like knowing what’s going on :/  I think I’m going to hire someone to read/watch every tweet/insta/TikTok post in my all feeds everyday and just give me a 10 min digest at the end of the day of what I need to know lol;3800;2400;104600
If a video is a banger, the algorithm will find an audience for it. The algorithm isn’t going to not promote your 90%+ retention video with high ctr just because it’s a minute shorter then what you usually post.;165;212;15300
Here are examples of 15+ minute videos, 10 minute videos, a 6 minute video, and sub 1 minute videos doing well for us.  People always ask me how long they should make their videos. It doesn’t matter! Just make the best video u possibly can and whatever length that is, upload it;423;713;28400
If done right, I think positivity can grow a person’s social media presence just as much as controversy. Random thought;1500;3500;101600
We're currently hiring for several positions! Please consider applying or sharing with friends  Video editors for gaming related content https://forms.gle/ZQCXtpDx7JRPKpav5…  Thumbnail designers https://forms.gle/FnwDyUzgDQjydqCE8…;2100;1900;25700
If you like playing Among Us you should get a job in airport security.;2400;5600;187900
Young me really be watching out for me ;247;279;35300
I love how a video that took young me 5 minutes to film had a better start then the video where I gave away a real island ;926;1700;90300
After 5 entire years the video finally went public!!!! GO WATCH ;1600;2000;114100
Idk why but I’ve always had this love for doing absurdly stupid pointless stuff. All these smaller challenges helped me build up the mental endurance to count to 100,000 when I dropped out of college haha;216;330;33200

Before and after. It was so brutal that I had to call in friends, they were so confused why I needed help sawing the table with only plastic knives ;192;359;26700
When I was in HS I randomly got curious at lunch if I could cut a table in half with only plastic knives. So on my way home I bought a table and 1000 plastic knives & spent the entire weekend cutting a table in half with only plastic knives 4 a vid. Idk how that evolved into this;974;2100;97800
It’s a video I filmed when I had 8,000 subscribers and scheduled uploaded 5 years in the future. Tomorrow is the big day!;523;949;60800
I’ve waited 1,824 days to upload tomorrow’s video ;1300;1800;93400
Should I remove “6969420” from my name or keep it for a week? You decide;2400;870;45100
Shoutout to my squad, they pretty dope;1200;1400;79700
On November 1st I’m dropping another limited edition shirt that will be signed! I see lots of people who are sad they missed the last one so I’ll do it one more time. It will be the last time I ever sign a shirt! (Assuming I don’t go crazy this time lol);1500;1300;72300
Let’s just give everyone $1,000,000. That should fix most our problems!;2300;2000;78000
Seeing how divided America is makes want to consider running for president one day (very far in the future, currently I’m stupid) but I also have “6969420” in my name atm from a Minecraft scavenger hunt so I doubt anyone would ever take me serious lmao;3700;6900;189100
Don't tell the streamers but there are hidden clues in the picture.. shh;388;282;34500
Use your big brains gamers. There are hints in the picture 0.o;383;234;33300
I convinced Dream to let me on his SMP server and I hid a $10,000 Taco Bell gift card (not sponsored I just think it’s hilarious  ) in this chest. Whoever finds it first, keeps it! Good luck gamers;3200;4300;148300
This is insane!;472;1000;30900
I love talking to random people that have dedicated their life to something. Whether it be investing, social media, sports, or stacking cups lol it’s consistently been the best way to inspire me creatively.  If you’re an interesting person reply to this tweet! I’d love to chat :D;11600;2500;92100
I’m watching a dude sculpt a toilet out of ice. What you up to?;3600;1100;88300
Jk, I wuv what I do;214;168;22800
I’m starting to question my decisions in life;186;241;25300
It’s funny that one video took tons of creative planning, weeks of prep, hundreds of thousands of dollars, lots of filming, and the other is me playing Among Us with my friends ;828;1300;66300
The US Navy comments on all my Instagram pictures and I don’t know what to do with this kind of power ;2700;3400;129699
I’ve probably spent 5+ hours a day all month thinking on this. I genuinely want to make the best content possible for you guys and I’ll do whatever it takes ;498;324;21800
Been thinking a lot recently about how I can evolve my content and take it up a notch. Going to test some bigger/weirder ideas and see how you guys like it :);1400;789;43700

In the new video I uploaded someone proposed to their girlfriend.. go watch!;595;618;44600
3 months ago I called a random phone number and told a guy he won $10,000 and he still to this day won’t take it. He thinks it’s a scam lol  I give up on this tik tok;10700;5100;172300
Unless of course you want to lose money! Then buy tons :D;468;422;42200
I’ve done 4 different videos where I bought $30,000 $50,000 $100,000 and even $1,000,000 worth of scratch off tickets and all four times I lost money. Don’t buy scratch off tickets, this just shows you’ll lose money.;2000;5000;119400
The new gaming video is hilarious!;578;475;19400
If you want your own picture of Mark Rober to tweet dm me;994;354;36600
Mark Rober;1300;1400;90300
Why would you make this? Lol;988;2000;72500
Later this year I’m flying down some subscribers to compete for $1,000,000. So if you’re not already subbed, I’d do it ;10700;6900;184500
I surprised my 40,000,000th subscriber with 40 cars lol, go watch!;2500;3100;91000
I guess technically three lol;217;247;20700
Both channels trending ;1100;1700;73600
I can force myself to do the dumbest things for 24 hours for videos but when I was in school I physically couldn’t do 10 minutes of homework without losing my mind. Just shows how much easier it is to grind when you’re passionate about something.;1200;5800;103600
Jimmy being completely honest with you. I've watched all your old videos to learn how YOU became YOU now, and this reminds me that you're a grinder, never stop my friend you're an inspiration!;85;190;12700
Just uploaded! Go watch it or I will round house kick you in the throat.;1900;1100;53100
For context, when I filmed that video I was in high school with $0 to my name. I couldn’t afford a camera so all the videos at the time were shot in low fps on my phone haha;263;330;31000
In two weeks a video I scheduled uploaded 5 years ago when I had 8,000 subscribers goes public! In it I tried to guess how many subscribers I’d have when the video went public LOL;759;1500;69300

Sorry the uploads have been slow. When I said I’d sign every shirt I sold I didn’t think it would take me 2 weeks of 10 hour days to sign them all... kind of messed up the upload schedule lol;1000;1000;72700
Zealous uploaded his first video after the 2 million subscriber shout out and I think he knocked out of the park!;440;406;17300
Going back at it, someone remind me to sleep tonight. Literally anything game with strategy is like a drug to me lol;438;220;21500
We started playing board games at 11pm last night and we just finished after 13 hours  I have a problem when it comes to strategy games lol;1300;1100;69100
I’m using Instagram stories again, don’t miss out on this peak content;1100;821;46600
Dear followers, I’m curious. Do you watch my YouTube videos?;6200;1200;39300
How did we all get so addicted to this app? I bet 90% of you reading this couldn’t quit using Twitter for a month if you tried.;23400;7800;172100
On a serious note I’d love to make a video on this topic sometime. I find it very fascinating and I feel like I’d have some good insight as someone that was fortunate enough to come into money at a young age. Idk I’ll go back to dumb tweets;693;323;25200
Ngl if you gave me a couple billion dollars I’d be pretty freaken happy. I’d grab maddy and fly around the world helping people lol;740;534;36500
Can money buy long term happiness?;11000;2700;48800
Hit me with things you think I could do better in my videos! I want to always improve ;7900;1100;64300
Update - I didn’t know this but tik tok pays royalties. Makes sense now;188;318;27700
To clarify I havnt had this issue in over a year! YouTube has done a good job fixing it. I just thought this was funny;103;218;21000
If big artists didn’t claim youtubers we’d use their music in videos and make memes out of them! If I played a song for 5 seconds it’s not going to stop them from buying your music but it will get 10,000,000+ people interested in the song. Idk but seems like a missed opportunity.;345;903;43100
I find it interesting that music artists will let their song be used on tik tok but if I say two words from their song in the wrong tone of voice they try to claim my YouTube video.;1200;3600;112000
It’s you and 3 other people in a circle and the last to leave gets $100,000. How long you staying?;42600;5500;109100
Zealous is #1 trending and almost on 1,400,000 subscribers in under a day! This is literally insane ;987;993;45600
Or we do it with big Youtubers for 10 million dollars and the winner has to give the money to their subscribers. Idk but giant epic battle royal on a private island sounds dope;1600;1100;61100
(Brainstorming ideas) What if we put 100 small Youtubers on a giant private island and did a battle royal of some sort? Last remaining hypothetically gets a shout out lol;7600;3700;123200
I just want to make sure I do it right. Walking into random hospital rooms and just shoving a camera in people’s face feels weird! I’ll brainstorm something we could do to make it a win win.;805;1200;75200
Since you guys have been relentlessly spamming this for a month now, I’ll do it :);2200;12100;170000
Someone help, it’s 2 AM;698;313;22800

I have a problem, I literally can’t stop thinking about this. I’m so excited that I physically can’t sleep lol;139;242;20800
It’s not up yet! Waiting until I have the food bank and the proper paperwork. I want it to be a legit charity and I also want to make sure I have proper transparency so people know without a shadow of a doubt 100% of all rev goes towards helping people.;92;140;8400
If we could grow the charity channel to a similar size as the gaming channel... ;101;178;10200
I’m so excited to open this Food Bank  soon and fire up the charity vlog (100% of all rev from the channel will go towards running my food bank and opening more!!) I’m DYING to see how big we can grow this :);740;1800;54400
He is over a million now!;394;262;20200
It’s been 2 hours and the winner of the small youtuber challenge already has 400,000 subscribers! I can’t wait to see what he does with them :D;1400;1100;70700
4 small youtubers put their hand on my diamond play button and the last to remove it got a massive shout out! Go watch the new video and support the winner!;781;843;44900
@ChrisO2_  @ChandlerHallow  @KarlJacobs_  let’s get swole as a joke boyz;218;278;27000
Me, Chris, Chandler, and Karl are going to lift everyday for 100 days. (Only Chris has actually agreed so far but I’m tweeting this so Chan and Karl feel peer pressured to join us lol);1200;1900;92600
Before you die you will on average walk 110,000 miles and the earth is 25,000 miles at the equator. So you could have walked around the world 4 and a half times before you die but you won’t. I’m disappointed in you.;3000;4200;100900
This Saturday’s video is insane! I had 4 small youtubers put their hand on my diamond play button and the last one to remove their hand got a shoutout..  How many subs do you think the winner will get on Saturday? ;2000;1100;56900
My right hand is done. I had to learn how to sign with my left to keep going  I will sign them all like I said!!!;382;305;28000
I’ve literally signed shirts for 10 days and I’m still not done LOL. It’s worth it though because this 40 mil subscriber special they are funding is epic :);717;921;50100
Me, Karl, and Chris already know what we want. Any idea what chandler should get? Lol;2700;343;24200
If the gaming channel hits 10 million subscribers before the end of the year me and the boys will each get a tattoo!;987;1300;39300
This Instagram account and this Facebook account is not me. I will ALWAYS do giveaways on my verified social medias only. If it’s not verified, it’s not me. Never trust friend requests or messages from non verified MrBeast accounts.;1200;2400;49100
 BIDDING IS FINISHED  THE WINNERS ARE: @G2esports  @Ninja  @AimLab  @MrBeastYT    With a combined donation of $1,000,000 for  @SpecialEffect    Probably the spiciest team up since The Avengers??????;1000;3900;48900
